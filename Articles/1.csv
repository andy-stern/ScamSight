"How Does AI Affect Security on the Internet?

"Introduction
",bold
"	In 2025, a lot of talk is centered around AI, Artificial Intelligence, and it is rightfully so. Today, around 99% of Fortune 500 (most profitable companies) use AI in their services and products. So, this means a lot of what you do on the Internet has AI in it—it’s all around us, but what is it? Usually, people think of AI as a chatbot, which will give human-like responses to an input, but a lot of the usage goes beyond chatting with people.

"A Brief History of AI
",bold
"	In the 1950s and 1960s, AI was a theory; no one expected it would become so tightly-integrated in our world in under 80 years. Computer scientists, such as Alan Turing, imagined it to be a big brain. This brain would be fed lots of information and form paths to predict examples that weren’t in the information it was given. If it’s wrong, it adjusts a little, and over millions of times, it gets very accurate. A bit later, in the 1970s, the idea was first implemented to do basic tasks. Into the 1980s and 1990s, AI blew up, with AIs beating chess grandmasters and recognizing some basic human speech.

"	Over the next 20 years, AI became advanced, going to chatbots and image generators. With all the good coming out of it, AI was a giant leap in human progress. With the good, however, goes the bad. Bad actors saw it as a perfect opportunity to perform tasks faster and better than any human. Insanely-realistic scams can be sent out on a huge scale. Cybercriminals can create identical voices of people, realistic images, and use them to scam others and cause harm. AI can create sophisticated malware and viruses way quicker than any hacker. More broad, AI could be used to make deepfakes of public figures to manipulate media or public opinion.

"Conclusion

"	So, how do we stay safe? Well, the answer is complex. On one hand, using caution and common sense can work, but as AI rapidly develops, it will become more and more human-like. For now, though, if you have a gut feeling, trust it.
