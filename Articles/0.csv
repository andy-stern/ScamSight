"How Fast Do Passwords Get Cracked?

","header"
"Introduction
","bold"
"	In the modern age, computers can be fast, really fast. So fast, in fact, that passwords of normal lengths have become obsolete in terms of security, but wait, let�s backtrack, what makes a password�s level of security?

","normal"
"Combinations
","bold"
"	First, you need to understand the possible number of combinations. If someone makes a password that is 8 characters long, but they only use letters, that is about 110 billion possible combinations. Wow! That�s a really large number.

"Password Storage
","bold"
"	Second, the way passwords are stored is a huge factor in their security. If passwords are stored on the server in plaintext, which is no change from what the user inputs, that is very insecure. However, that�s why hashing exists. Hashing functions take an input of any length (�a� or 5 billion words) and it will always produce an output of the same length, making it impossible to reverse the output. Furthermore, modern hashing methods are slow to do, which can give a buffer against attackers.

"Back to the Numbers
","bold"
"	Back to the 110 billion combinations. On a slightly above-average computer, it may take about a million years, give or take, so unless attackers have a lot of time, even 6-character passwords are safe with modern hashing methods, but there�s a catch: quantum computing.

"Quantum Computing
","bold"
"	Taking another step back, what is quantum computing? Unlike classical computers that use bits as 0s or 1s, represented by electricity being on or off, quantum computers use qubits, which can be in multiple states of 0s and 1s at the same time. Through mind-boggling physics, this allows them to be much, much faster at cracking passwords.
