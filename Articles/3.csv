"What is the Craze With Cryptocurrencies?

",header
"Introduction
",bold
"	When you purchase something, you probably use a credit or debit card. This is the case for most Americans. With credit and debit cards, they are centralized, which means one entity or a small group of entities control that thing. Credit and debit cards’ centralization lies in a few banks that manage card issuing, and a larger pond of banks that hold funds for debit cards. Furthermore, the government provides oversight, protections, and monitors activity within this system. This is why cryptocurrencies were created: to have a decentralized system, where no person or small group of people have full control over it.

"What is Cryptocurrency?
",bold
"	Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography for transactions. Unlike credit and debit cards using your name and identity as a unique identifier, cryptocurrencies use cryptography to provide an anonymized, yet unique, identifier. For transactions, it uses a blockchain, which is a system to record and do transactions, which is hosted over every computer on the blockchain. This is where decentralization comes from: everyone participates in the system.

"The Benefits of Cryptocurrency
",bold
"	The biggest advantage of using cryptocurrency is the decentralization, which prevents manipulation, hacking, and data breaches. On blockchains, such as Bitcoin, all transactions and wallet balances are public, but individual wallets require a password to access funds. Furthermore, transactions don’t need any approval, meaning transactions of any size are instant. For people in controlling areas that do not allow many banking options, cryptocurrency is a great way to store funds anonymously.

"The Inevitable Downsides
",bold
"	On the flip side, however, without a central power controlling values of the currency, they can be volatile. For example, Bitcoin may drop down thousands of dollars one moment then go up a few the next. Another concern is the illegal activities that can come from it. As transactions are anonymous, meaning no one knows who it is, money laundering, ransomware, and black market purchases are free to occur. For cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, they require miners, which try to solve complex mathematical problems to get one Bitcoin. However, they use lots of energy and have begun to show significant environmental impacts.

"The Current Situation of Cryptocurrency
",bold
"	As of now, cryptocurrency is partly-intertwined with the world. Major companies are starting to accept them for payments, and  financial institutions are making products and services based on cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Governments, however, are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies while balancing consumer privacy. Some countries have embraced it, but some nations have rejected it. Therefore, as the debate over it continues, one question lingers: can cryptocurrencies ever fully integrate into worldwide finance without undermining security and stability?
